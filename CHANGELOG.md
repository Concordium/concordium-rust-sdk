## Unreleased changes

- Add helpers to `WalletAccount` so that it can be constructed from genesis
  account format produced by the genesis creator tool, as well as from browser
  key export format.
- Fix contract schema's `to_json` to output contract addresses in the correct format.

## 2.1.0

- Add `WalletAccount` type that can be parsed from the browser extension wallet
  export. This supports the signer interface and so can be used to send transactions.


## 2.0.0

- Expose macros for deriving `Serial` and `Deserial` from `concordium-contracts-common`.
- Address method `is_alias_of` is now `is_alias`.
- Replaced `ReceiveName` and `InitName` with `OwnedReceiveName` and `OwnedContractName` from `concordium-contracts-common`.
- Remove `ContractAddress` and `Address` in favor of their equivalents in `concordium-contracts-common`.
- `AccountAddress::new` is replaced by a function called `account_address_from_registration_id`.
- `Amount` now has a field `micro_ccd` instead of `microgtu`.
- The default arithmetic (operator syntax, such as `+`, `-`, `*`) with `Amount` is now unchecked.
- There are no longer implementations of `From<u64> for Amount` and `From<Amount> for u64` as the behavior of these is not obvious.
  Instead, the functions `Amount::from_micro_ccd` or `Amount::from_ccd` and the getter `micro_ccd` should be used instead.
- Implement `Display` and `FromStr` for `ContractAddress` formatted as `<index, subindex>`, E.g `<145,0>`.
- Implement `Display` and `FromStr` for `Address`. The latter attempts to parse a contract address. If this fails it will attempt to parse an `AccountAddress`.
- Implement `FromStr` for `OwnedReceiveName`.
- Remove the `From<Vec<u8>>` implementation for `Parameter`. Instead a `TryFrom` is
  provided that checks the length.
- Add support for the node's GRPC V2 interface.
- Bump minimum supported Rust version to 1.57.
- Add support for CIS0 standard.
- The CIS2 support now uses the V2 node API. This has led so small changes in
  the API.
- Add support for protocol version 5 events and limitations.
- Deprecate `add_baker`, `update_baker_keys`, `remove_baker`,
  `update_baker_stake`, `update_baker_restake_earnings` functions. They only
  apply to protocol versions 1-3 and are replaced by `configure_baker`.

## 1.1.0

Bump minimum supported Rust version to 1.56.

## 1.0.3

- Add V1 variant of root and level 1 key updates.
- Expose helper methods to wait for new blocks or finalization.
- Add some helper methods to `InstanceInfo`, `ElectionDifficulty` and
  `DelegationTarget` types.
- Expose types and functions for interacting with CIS2 smart contracts.

## 1.0.2

- Let AmountFraction derive Display.
- Fix JSON parsing bug.

## 1.0.0

- Replace `send_transaction` with `send_block_item`.
- Support protocol version 4 data formats.
- Support node version 4 API.
